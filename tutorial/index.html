        <h2>Explore the app</h2>
        <p>
            Once the application is <a href="#run">started</a> you can test it's functionality by invoking http requests. You can do it using any tool you like (some useful ones are <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm">Postman for Chrome</a> or <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/pl/firefox/addon/restclient/">RESTClient for Firefox</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            All accessible routes are defined in <a href="#code/src/main/scala/io/scalac/seed/vehicle/route/VehicleRoute.scala">VehicleRoute.scala</a> file.<br />
            For example following POST request could be used to create a new vehicle:
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                Request:
                POST http://localhost:8080/api/vehicles
                {"regNumber": "123", "color": "red"}

                Response:
                201 Created
                </pre>
            </code>
        </p>
	</div>
    <div>
        <h2>Actor per request</h2>
        <p>
            Every time new request is received an instance of specific <a href="#code/src/main/scala/io/scalac/seed/vehicle/route/VehiclePerRequestActor.scala">PerRequest</a> actor is created.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are separate actors for each possible request (RegisterVehicleRequestActor, DeleteVehicleRequestActor, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
            When such PerRequest actor is created it immediately sends a message to <a href="#code/src/main/scala/io/scalac/seed/vehicle/service/VehicleAggregateManager.scala">VehicleAggregateManager</a> actor, which handles the request and returns the result.
            PerRequest actor handles result returned from VehicleAggregateManager and responds with proper http response.
        </p>
        <p>
            More information on per-request pattern can be found in <a href="https://typesafe.com/activator/template/spray-actor-per-request">Actor per-request model with spray activator template</a>.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Eventsourcing</h2>
        <p>
            When <a href="#code/src/main/scala/io/scalac/seed/vehicle/service/VehicleAggregateManager.scala">VehicleAggregateManager</a> receives new command it instantiates new vehicle aggregate actor and forwards command to it.
        </p>
        <p>
            When aggregate is instantiated it is restored from historical events (akka persistence module takes care of it).
        </p>
        <p>
            Only when aggregate is fully restored it can handle "regular" messages (commands in this case).
        </p>
        <p>
            When aggregate receives new command it creates an event out of it and persists it in journal. Persisted event is then applied to aggregate.
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>

    <div>
        <h2>Snapshots</h2>
        <p>Snapshots are used to reduce recovery time of aggregates.</p>
        <p>VehicleAggregate handles taking snapshots itself. It tracks number of processed events and takes snapshot once 10 of them were processed.</p>

        <p>Here you'll find some learning resources that we strongly recommend in order to fully understand how does the application work.</p>
