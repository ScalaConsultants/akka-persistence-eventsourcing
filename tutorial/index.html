        <h2>Explore the app</h2>
        <p>
            Once the application is <a href="#run">started</a> you can test it's functionality by invoking http requests. You can do it using any tool you like (some useful ones are <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm">Postman for Chrome</a> or <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/pl/firefox/addon/restclient/">RESTClient for Firefox</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            All accessible routes are defined in <a href="#code/src/main/scala/io/scalac/seed/route/VehicleRoute.scala">VehicleRoute.scala</a> and <a href="#code/src/main/scala/io/scalac/seed/route/UserRoute.scala">UserRoute.scala</a> files.<br />
            Example requests for each route are shown below (POST ones require header "Content-Type: application/json" to be set):

    <div>
        <h2>Request handlers</h2>
        <p>
            Every time new request is received an instance of specific <a href="#code/src/main/scala/io/scalac/seed/route/RequestHandler.scala">RequestHandler</a> actor is created.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since each request can result in different status code for the same aggregate state (for example Removed state for GET request should result in NotFound, for DELETE however it should return NoContent) there are separate actors for each possible request (RegisterRequestActor, DeleteRequestActor, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
            When such RequestHandler actor is created it immediately sends a message to <a href="#code/src/main/scala/io/scalac/seed/service/AggregateManager.scala">AggregateManager</a> actor, which handles the request and returns the result.
            RequestHandler actor handles result returned from AggregateManager and responds with proper http response.
        </p>
        <p>
            This pattern is inspired by <a href="https://typesafe.com/activator/template/spray-actor-per-request">spray-actor-per-request</a> Activator template and more information can be found there.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Event sourcing</h2>
        <p>
            When <a href="#code/src/main/scala/io/scalac/seed/service/AggregateManager.scala">AggregateManager</a> receives new command it instantiates new aggregate actor and forwards command to it.
        </p>
        <p>
            When aggregate is instantiated it is restored from historical events (akka persistence module takes care of it).
        </p>
        <p>
            Only when aggregate is fully restored it can handle "regular" messages (commands in this case).
        </p>
        <p>
            When aggregate receives new command it creates an event out of it and persists it in journal. Persisted event is then applied to aggregate.
        </p>

        <h2>Snapshots</h2>
        <p>Snapshots are used to reduce recovery time of aggregates.</p>
        <p>VehicleAggregate handles taking snapshots itself. It tracks number of processed events and takes snapshot once 10 of them were processed.</p>
